# Security Policy

## 🔒 Security Philosophy

The RLHF Audit Trail project handles sensitive machine learning data, human annotations, and compliance-critical information. We take security seriously and follow industry best practices for data protection and privacy preservation.

## 🚨 Supported Versions

We provide security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 0.1.x   | ✅ |
| < 0.1   | ❌ |

## 🔍 Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report security vulnerabilities to:

- **Email**: security@terragonlabs.com
- **Subject**: `[SECURITY] RLHF Audit Trail Vulnerability Report`
- **PGP Key**: Available at [keybase.io/terragonlabs](https://keybase.io/terragonlabs)

### What to Include

Please include the following information in your report:

1. **Description** of the vulnerability
2. **Steps to reproduce** the issue
3. **Potential impact** assessment
4. **Affected versions** (if known)
5. **Suggested fix** (if you have one)
6. **Your contact information** for follow-up

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 24 hours
- **Status Update**: Within 72 hours
- **Fix Timeline**: 7-30 days depending on severity
- **Public Disclosure**: After fix is released and deployed

## 🔐 Security Features

### Data Protection
- **Differential Privacy**: Built-in privacy protection for human annotations
- **Encryption at Rest**: All audit logs are encrypted using AES-256
- **Secure Transport**: TLS 1.3 for all network communications
- **Key Management**: Integration with cloud KMS services

### Access Control
- **Role-Based Access**: Granular permissions for different user types
- **API Authentication**: OAuth 2.0 and API key-based authentication
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging of all access and modifications
- **Session Management**: Secure session handling with automatic expiration

### Compliance
- **EU AI Act Compliance**: Built-in compliance checks and reporting
- **GDPR Ready**: Privacy-by-design architecture
- **NIST Framework**: Alignment with NIST AI risk management framework
- **SOC 2 Compatible**: Logging and controls suitable for SOC 2 audits

## 🚫 Security Considerations

### What We Protect Against
- **Data Poisoning**: Cryptographic verification of training data integrity
- **Model Extraction**: Differential privacy prevents model parameter leakage
- **Adversarial Attacks**: Robust logging of anomalous behavior
- **Insider Threats**: Comprehensive audit trails and access controls
- **Supply Chain**: Dependency scanning and SBOM generation

### Known Limitations
- **Local Storage**: Users must secure local storage configurations
- **Cloud Permissions**: Proper IAM configuration is user's responsibility
- **Network Security**: TLS termination and network policies are environmental
- **Backup Security**: Backup encryption and access control is user-managed

## 🛡️ Security Best Practices

### For Developers
```bash
# Install with security extras
pip install rlhf-audit-trail[security]

# Enable security scanning
pre-commit install
pip-audit --desc

# Use secure defaults
from rlhf_audit_trail import AuditableRLHF, SecurityConfig

auditor = AuditableRLHF(
    security_config=SecurityConfig(
        enable_encryption=True,
        enable_access_logging=True,
        require_tls=True,
        privacy_mode="strict"
    )
)
```

### For Operators
- **Environment Variables**: Never commit secrets to version control
- **Network Security**: Use VPCs and security groups
- **Key Rotation**: Implement regular key rotation policies
- **Monitoring**: Set up security monitoring and alerting
- **Backups**: Encrypt backups and test restoration procedures

### For Data Scientists
- **Data Sanitization**: Remove PII before processing
- **Privacy Budgets**: Monitor differential privacy epsilon consumption
- **Model Security**: Validate model integrity before deployment
- **Compliance Checks**: Regular compliance validation reports

## 📋 Security Audits

### Regular Security Activities
- **Dependency Scanning**: Automated daily scans with Dependabot
- **SAST**: Static analysis with CodeQL on every PR
- **Container Scanning**: Regular container vulnerability scans
- **Penetration Testing**: Annual third-party security assessments

### Compliance Auditing
- **EU AI Act**: Quarterly compliance assessments
- **Privacy Impact**: Annual privacy impact assessments
- **SOC 2**: External SOC 2 Type II audit preparation
- **GDPR**: Regular GDPR compliance reviews
