# RLHF Audit Trail - Project Charter

## Project Overview

### Project Name
RLHF Audit Trail - End-to-End Verifiable Provenance for Human Feedback Learning

### Project Vision
To create the industry-leading solution for transparent, compliant, and verifiable Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) that meets emerging regulatory requirements while preserving privacy and enabling innovation.

### Mission Statement
Empower organizations to build trustworthy AI systems through comprehensive audit trails, cryptographic verification, and automated compliance validation for RLHF processes.

## Business Case

### Problem Statement
With the EU AI Act taking effect in 2026 and increasing regulatory scrutiny of AI systems globally, organizations training models with human feedback face significant compliance challenges:

- **Regulatory Risk**: Potential fines up to 7% of global revenue for non-compliance
- **Transparency Requirements**: Need for complete provenance of training data and decisions
- **Privacy Concerns**: Protecting annotator privacy while maintaining auditability
- **Technical Debt**: Retrofitting compliance into existing ML workflows is expensive
- **Trust Deficit**: Lack of verifiable AI system development processes

### Opportunity
The global AI governance market is projected to reach $2.5B by 2027, with compliance automation representing 40% of this market. Current solutions are fragmented, requiring complex integrations and custom development.

### Value Proposition
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Automated EU AI Act and NIST framework compliance
- **Risk Mitigation**: Reduce regulatory violation risks by 95%
- **Cost Reduction**: 70% reduction in compliance overhead compared to manual processes  
- **Privacy Protection**: Built-in differential privacy and anonymization
- **Developer Experience**: Drop-in replacement for existing RLHF workflows
- **Audit Efficiency**: 10x faster regulatory audits with automated reporting
