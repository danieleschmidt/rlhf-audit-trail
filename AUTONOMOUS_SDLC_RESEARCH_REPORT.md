```

### 3.2 Quantum-Inspired Optimization

#### 3.2.1 Resource Allocation Algorithm

Our quantum-inspired resource allocation algorithm operates on the principle of superposition states and quantum entanglement:

```python
def optimize_allocation(current_allocation, target_metrics, constraints):
    # Initialize quantum population with superposition states
    population = initialize_quantum_population(current_allocation)
    
    for generation in range(max_generations):
        # Evolve population using quantum operators
        population = evolve_quantum_population(population, target_metrics)
        
        # Apply quantum crossover and mutation
        population = apply_quantum_operators(population, constraints)
        
        # Evaluate fitness with quantum coherence factor
        best_solution = evaluate_with_quantum_fitness(population)
        
        if convergence_criteria_met(best_solution):
            break
    
    return best_solution
```

#### 3.2.2 Quantum Coherence Metrics

We define quantum coherence in the context of resource allocation as:

**Coherence Score = 1 - (σ(states) / μ(states))**

Where σ represents standard deviation and μ represents mean of quantum states.

- **Threshold Adapter**: Hybrid learning for dynamic threshold adjustment

#### 3.3.2 Self-Improving Mechanisms

```python
async def autonomous_improvement_cycle():
    performance = evaluate_current_performance()
    
    if performance < threshold_poor:
        await aggressive_retraining()
    elif performance < threshold_moderate:
        await incremental_learning()
    elif performance > threshold_excellent:
        await architecture_optimization()
    
    await update_adaptive_thresholds()
```

### 3.4 Adaptive Caching System

#### 3.4.1 Quantum-Enhanced Eviction

Our adaptive caching system uses quantum-inspired eviction algorithms:

```python
def quantum_eviction_score(entry):
    quantum_coherence = calculate_coherence(entry.quantum_states)
    access_pattern = analyze_access_pattern(entry.key)
    entanglement = calculate_entanglement_factor(entry)
    
    score = (
        (1 - quantum_coherence) * 0.25 +
        (1 - access_pattern) * 0.3 +
        age_factor * 0.15 +
        recency_factor * 0.2 +
        (1 - entanglement) * 0.1
    )
    
    return score
```
