# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records for the RLHF Audit Trail project. ADRs document important architectural decisions made during development.

## What is an ADR?

An Architecture Decision Record (ADR) is a document that captures an important architecture decision made along with its context and consequences. ADRs help teams:

- Track the reasoning behind architectural choices
- Provide context for future developers
- Enable better decision-making
- Maintain institutional knowledge

## ADR Format

Each ADR follows a consistent format:
- **Title**: Brief description of the decision
- **Status**: Current status (Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, Superseded)
- **Context**: Background and problem being solved
- **Decision**: The chosen solution and rationale
- **Consequences**: Expected positive and negative outcomes
- **Alternatives Considered**: Other options that were evaluated

## Current ADRs

| # | Title | Status |
|---|-------|--------|
| [0001](0001-architecture-decision-record-template.md) | Architecture Decision Record Template | Accepted |
| [0002](0002-python-technology-stack.md) | Python Technology Stack Selection | Accepted |
| [0003](0003-cryptographic-audit-trail-design.md) | Cryptographic Audit Trail Design | Accepted |

## Creating New ADRs

1. Copy the template from ADR-0001
2. Number sequentially (e.g., 0004-your-decision.md)
3. Fill in all sections with relevant information
4. Start with "Proposed" status
5. Update to "Accepted" when approved
6. Link from this README

## ADR Lifecycle

- **Proposed**: Initial draft, under review
- **Accepted**: Approved and implemented
- **Deprecated**: No longer applicable but kept for historical context
- **Superseded**: Replaced by a newer ADR (link to replacement)
