# ADR-0001: Architecture Decision Record Template

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We need a structured way to document architectural decisions made during the development of the RLHF Audit Trail system. Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) help us:

- Track the reasoning behind important architectural choices
- Provide context for future developers
- Enable better decision-making by learning from past decisions
- Maintain institutional knowledge

## Decision
We will use Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) to document all significant architectural decisions. Each ADR will follow this template structure:

1. **Title**: Short descriptive title
2. **Status**: Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, or Superseded
3. **Context**: The situation and problem statement
4. **Decision**: The architectural decision and rationale
5. **Consequences**: Expected outcomes, both positive and negative
6. **Alternatives Considered**: Other options that were evaluated

## Consequences
**Positive:**
- Better documentation of architectural decisions
- Easier onboarding for new team members
- Historical context for future architectural decisions
- Improved architectural consistency

**Negative:**
- Additional overhead in decision-making process
- Requires discipline to maintain

## Alternatives Considered
- Wiki-based documentation: Less structured, harder to track
- Code comments only: Limited scope and visibility
- No formal documentation: Risk of losing institutional knowledge
