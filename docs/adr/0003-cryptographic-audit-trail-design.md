# ADR-0003: Cryptographic Audit Trail Design

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The RLHF Audit Trail system requires cryptographically verifiable audit logs to ensure:
- Immutable record of all RLHF operations
- Tamper detection for compliance requirements
- Non-repudiation of training events
- Regulatory compliance (EU AI Act, NIST)

We need to select appropriate cryptographic primitives and design patterns that balance security, performance, and regulatory requirements.

## Decision
We will implement a hierarchical cryptographic audit trail with the following design:

**Hash Function:** SHA-256 for all integrity hashing
**Merkle Tree Structure:** Binary merkle trees for batch integrity proofs
**Digital Signatures:** Ed25519 for event signing
**Timestamping:** RFC 3161 compliant timestamping where required

**Architecture:**
1. Each audit event is hashed using SHA-256
2. Events are batched and organized into merkle trees
3. Merkle roots are signed with Ed25519 private keys
4. Periodic integrity checkpoints create tamper-evident chains
5. External timestamping for critical regulatory events

**Storage:**
- Raw events stored encrypted (AES-256-GCM)
- Merkle proofs stored separately for verification
- Digital signatures maintained with event metadata

## Consequences
**Positive:**
- Cryptographically verifiable audit trails
- Efficient batch verification using merkle proofs
- Strong tamper detection capabilities
- Meets regulatory non-repudiation requirements
- Efficient storage and verification

**Negative:**
- Additional computational overhead for hashing/signing
- Complexity in key management
- Storage overhead for cryptographic metadata

## Alternatives Considered
- **Blockchain-based**: Too heavy and energy-intensive
- **Simple digital signatures**: Less efficient for batch verification
- **Hash chains only**: Limited tamper detection capabilities
- **RSA signatures**: Larger signature size, slower operations
