# ADR-0002: Python Technology Stack Selection

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We need to select the core technology stack for the RLHF Audit Trail system. The system must support:
- High-performance machine learning workloads
- Cryptographic operations for audit trail integrity
- Regulatory compliance requirements
- Integration with existing RLHF libraries
- Scalable web services and APIs

## Decision
We have chosen Python 3.10+ as the primary language with the following stack:

**Core Framework:**
- FastAPI for web services and APIs
- SQLAlchemy 2.0+ for database ORM
- Pydantic v2 for data validation

**ML/AI Libraries:**
- PyTorch 2.3+ for deep learning
- Transformers 4.40+ for model handling
- TRL/trlx for RLHF integration
- Opacus for differential privacy

**Infrastructure:**
- PostgreSQL for relational data
- Redis for caching and task queues
- Celery for distributed task processing

**Security/Compliance:**
- Cryptography library for encryption
- Merkletools for integrity proofs
- Custom compliance validation modules

## Consequences
**Positive:**
- Rich ecosystem for ML/AI development
- Strong typing support with Pydantic and mypy
- Excellent library support for cryptographic operations
- Easy integration with existing RLHF tools
- Strong community and documentation

**Negative:**
- Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) limitations for CPU-bound tasks
- Deployment complexity compared to compiled languages
- Dependency management complexity

## Alternatives Considered
- **Rust**: Better performance but limited ML ecosystem
- **Go**: Good for services but weak ML support  
- **Node.js**: Good for APIs but poor ML ecosystem
- **Java**: Enterprise-ready but verbose for ML workflows
